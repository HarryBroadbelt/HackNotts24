# HackNotts24

## Welcome to our HackNotts24 project - Chicken and Egg

Our esoteric programming language is known as BinLang!. It takes a binary input from the user and executes the command they have given via a .py file known as out.py.

Our initial plan was to produce a generative text AI bot to create a text-based adventure esoteric programming language, however we were unfortunatrly unable to since there were difficulties with libraries needed for the actual AI and finding relevant resources to fulfill the task.

### Instructions of Use

Write your BinLang script in the input test file using the given grammar as a guide, and then run the mail file to compile and execute your code.
