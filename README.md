## Welcome to our HackNotts24 project!



## Plan

- When player enters dungeon, NLP generates story text (kept in [] for parsing)
- user makes choice e.g. 1, 2 or 3 and enters it in text file
- when dungeon is completed, parser ignores all NLP story
- Parser reads commands and uses command lookup dictionary and adds the corresponding commands to an executable text file
- the text file is then compiled and executed, the program is ran!

- stretch goals:
- if the program compiles and runs successfully, the user gains cash money
- cash money can be spent at the shop for more commands
