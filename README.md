# HackNotts24

## Welcome to our HackNotts24 project - BinLang

Our esoteric programming language is known as BinLang!. It takes a (mostly) binary input from the user and executes the command they have given via a .py file known as out.py.

Our initial plan was to produce a generative text AI bot to create a text-based adventure esoteric programming language, however we were unfortunatrly unable to since there were difficulties with libraries needed for the actual AI and finding relevant resources to fulfill the task.

### Instructions of Use

You need the main.py, lexing.py, parserrr.py and commands.py files on your system at the very least. Code written in BinLang is written in simple .txt files and the main.py is changed to reflect the filename (note: we should remove this step in the process somehow). Then main.py is run, which runs out.py on its own.
