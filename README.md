# HackNotts24

## Welcome to our HackNotts24 project - Chicken and Egg

Our esoteric programming language is known as Chicken. It takes a binary input from the user and executes the command they have given via a .py file known as egg.txt.

Our initial plan was to produce a generative text AI bot to create a text-based adventure esoteric programming language, however we were unfortunatrly unable to since there were difficulties with libraries needed for the actual AI and finding relevant resources to fulfill the task.

### Instructions of Use

Write your Chicken script in the input file and then run the makefile to compile and execute your code.
